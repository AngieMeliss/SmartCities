## Panic Button App: Empowering Citizens in Emergency Situations

# Project description:

Developed as the sole developer, a mobile application aimed at empowering citizens to seek help and assistance during emergency situations. The app features a prominent red button labeled "Panic button," which users can activate to generate alarms and events when encountering situations such as traffic accidents, robberies, harassment, arson, and more.
In addition to the panic button feature, users can register accounts, access various sections, add emergency contacts, and send event details to authorities or trusted individuals.

For a more detailed overview of the app's functionality, please refer to the accompanying video demonstration.

The Panic Button App serves as a valuable tool for citizens in distress, providing them with a quick and accessible means of alerting others and seeking assistance during emergency situations. By incorporating features such as user registration, contact management, and event reporting, the app enhances users' ability to communicate effectively and efficiently during times of crisis.

The APIs were generated and tested using Postman to ensure seamless integration and functionality. In my role as the sole designer and developer of the app, I proposed the idea and worked on its implementation. Recognizing the need for accessibility, particularly in emergency cases, I devised a solution to allow the app's use even without user sign-up.
This involved the creation of a generic and anonymous user profile specifically for emergency situations, ensuring that crucial location data could still be transmitted. Additionally, I designed the interface for the login functionality, which operated seamlessly with email credentials. Furthermore, I established the entire structure for consuming the APIs, ensuring efficient communication and data exchange between the app and external services.

I also worked with assets for managing images and icons, utilizing the Material Library from Google to organize widgets and maintain a tidy interface. Participating in this project was vital for fostering idea exchange, teamwork, and collaborative thinking.
